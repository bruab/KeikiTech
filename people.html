              <p>I'm a Master's student in the ICS program at UH Manoa, and I work as Research Support at the USDA-PBARC here in Hilo. Before I moved to Hawai'i I was an Assistant Director at a Montessori kindergarten in South Korea. I do this because I find comfort and amusement in being reminded how people a fraction of my age can be so much smarter than me :-)</p>

              <p>I'll be a Junior in the UHH Computer Science program this Fall, and I love to code. Most of my experience is from game development as a hobby in high school, but now I mostly develop Bioinformatics software at PBARC (which sounds a lot fancier than it really is). Software development can be a fun hobby and is a great career path since it's a growing industry, so I think all kids who are interested in the nuts and bolts of computers should have the opportunity to learn.</p>
